# liri-node-app

Like SIRI, but LIRI! However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a *Language* Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in the user input and brings back movie, concert, and song data. 

To search LIRI, enter the following commands to find information on the movie, song name, or upcoming you would like to find. The last command "do-this" brings in the movie, song, or concert data from a seperate text file.

* movie
* spotify
* concert
* do-this

How To Use:
1. Open terminal or bash.
2. Navigate to the folder where LIRI is stored on your computer.
3. Type in "node liri.js (command) (movie, song name, or artist)"
